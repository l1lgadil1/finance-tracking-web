   - Three `FinancialSummaryCard` components displaying Total Income, Total Expenses, and Net Balance
   - Each card includes trend indicators and percent change

3. **Income vs Expenses Chart**
   - Bar chart comparing income and expenses over time
   - Filter controls for data refinement
   - Responsive container to ensure proper display across devices

4. **Category Breakdown and Trends**

5. **AI Insights**

2. **Period Selection**
   - User can select time periods, affecting data display
   - State management handles period selection and date range filtering

   - Category data will be derived from transaction categorization
   - Mock data currently used for demonstration

4. **AI Insights**
   - Will be integrated with backend AI analysis endpoints
   - Currently using sample insights for the UI design

## Responsive Behavior
