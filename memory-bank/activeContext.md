# Active Context: AqshaTracker Backend MVP

## Current Focus

- **MVP Complete:** The initial backend MVP implementation based on the plan and clarifications is finished.
- **Next Phase:** Awaiting user feedback, further requirements, or selection of post-MVP tasks (e.g., testing, deployment prep, feature refinement).

## Recent Changes

- Implemented Phase 1: Core Setup & Dependencies.
- Implemented Phase 2: Authentication & User Management.
- Implemented Phase 3: Core Entity CRUD (Profile, Account, Category).
- Implemented Phase 4: Transaction Module (including balance updates & filtering).
- Implemented Phase 5: Remaining Entity CRUD (Goal, Subscription, AIRequestLog).
- Updated Memory Bank (`progress.md`).

## Next Steps

- **Testing:** Add unit and end-to-end tests.
- **Refinement:** Address TODOs noted in code (e.g., `debt_repay` logic, deletion checks).
- **Data Mapping:** Replace `as any` casts in controllers with proper DTO mapping/serialization.
- **Linting:** Investigate and resolve persistent linter errors.
- **Deployment:** Prepare for deployment (Dockerfile refinement, etc.).
- **New Features:** Implement features from the post-MVP list in `progress.md` based on priority.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Need to decide on the priority for post-MVP tasks.
- Need to clarify the desired behavior for deleting entities with dependencies (e.g., Account with balance, Category with transactions).
- Need to investigate the root cause of the persistent linter errors.
