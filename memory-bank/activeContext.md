# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are working on improving the UI/UX and data visualization capabilities of the AqshaTracker financial tracking application. We've enhanced the existing UI components, implemented responsive dashboard layouts for financial data visualization, improved the theme system with consistent color variables, and enhanced accessibility.

## Current Work

We have recently designed and implemented a comprehensive Analytics page for AqshaTracker that provides users with detailed financial visualizations and insights. The page follows existing design patterns and component library while introducing more advanced data visualization techniques.

### Recent Changes

- Created a detailed UI/UX design for the Analytics page with multiple visualization components
- Implemented responsive layouts with proper desktop, tablet, and mobile considerations
- Integrated existing FinancialSummaryCard components for key metrics display
- Used Recharts library for various chart types (bar, pie, line) with theme awareness
- Added time period selection controls with custom date range functionality
- Implemented AI insights section for displaying financial recommendations
- Created comprehensive documentation for the Analytics page design
- Fixed integration issues with DashboardDataProvider by properly wrapping components and passing locale

## Recent Accomplishments

1. Created a comprehensive UI showcase page that documents all available components in the application.
2. Implemented new components specifically designed for financial applications:
   - `DatePicker`: A calendar-based date selection component with locale support
   - `ProgressBar`: A customizable progress visualization component for tracking financial goals
   - `Dialog`: A confirmation dialog with support for various financial interactions
   - `CurrencyInput`: A specialized input for handling currency values with formatting
   - `TransactionCard`: A card component for displaying transaction information in a consistent way
   - `TransactionDetail`: A component for displaying detailed transaction information
   - `FinancialSummaryCard`: A card component for displaying financial summaries with trends
   - `AccountSelector`: A specialized dropdown for selecting financial accounts with balance display
   - `CategorySelector`: A searchable dropdown for selecting transaction categories by type

3. Implemented flexible and responsive dashboard layout components:
   - `DashboardLayout`: A responsive layout manager with support for different screen sizes
   - `DashboardWidget`: A standardized widget container with consistent styling
   - `DashboardExample`: A comprehensive example dashboard using all financial components

4. Enhanced accessibility features:
   - Created detailed accessibility guidelines document
   - Improved AccountSelector component with proper ARIA attributes
   - Added keyboard navigation support to interactive components
   - Implemented proper focus management
   - Added appropriate semantic HTML and screen reader support

5. Enhanced components are designed to:
   - Support both light and dark themes
   - Be fully accessible
   - Provide consistent interfaces
   - Handle financial data appropriately
   - Support localization
   - Provide proper visual feedback for all interaction states
   - Adapt to different screen sizes responsively

6. Improved the theme system and UI color consistency:
   - Created a dashboard UI/UX guide documenting theme usage standards
   - Updated all dashboard section components to use theme variables:
     - Replaced hardcoded colors (bg-white, bg-gray-*) with semantic theme variables (bg-background, bg-card, etc.)
     - Updated text colors to use text-foreground and text-muted-foreground
     - Made borders consistent with border-border
     - Standardized hover states using bg-card-hover
   - Enhanced dashboard components for dark mode compatibility
   - Updated AccountsSection, TransactionsSection, OverviewSection, GoalsSection, AnalyticsSection, and AqshaAISection

7. Created a comprehensive Analytics page:
   - Implemented multiple chart types (bar, pie, line) for different financial visualizations
   - Provided period selection controls with custom date range options
   - Designed responsive layouts for all device sizes
   - Integrated with the DashboardDataProvider for real transaction data
   - Implemented AI-driven financial insights section

## Next Steps

1. Connect the Analytics page to real category data and implement full filtering capabilities
2. Develop the AI insights backend functionality for smarter financial recommendations
3. Add data export and report generation features to the Analytics page
4. Enhance accessibility features specifically for chart components
5. Update remaining components to use the theme system
6. Implement comprehensive loading and error states across the application
7. Enhance mobile experience for financial tracking on-the-go
8. Complete test coverage for UI components

## Active Decisions

1. **Component Architecture**: We've decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme variables, and Framer Motion for animations to create a polished user experience.

2. **Financial Data Display**: We're standardizing on currency display formats, consistent visualization of financial metrics, and intuitive data entry methods specific to financial workflows.

3. **Theme Strategy**: We're implementing a comprehensive theming system with semantic color tokens (bg-background, text-foreground, etc.) for consistent UI across the application, supporting both light and dark modes. All components must use these tokens instead of hardcoded colors.

4. **UI Component Structure**: Components are organized in a modular way in `src/shared/ui` directory, with each component having its own folder containing index.tsx file and any related sub-components.

5. **Transaction Visualization**: We've standardized on visual indicators for transaction types (income, expense, transfer, debt) with consistent color coding and iconography.

6. **Dashboard Layout**: We've implemented a flexible dashboard layout system that works across different screen sizes with special attention to mobile responsiveness.

7. **Accessibility Strategy**: We've adopted a comprehensive approach to accessibility, focusing on:
   - Proper semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA attributes and landmarks
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Focus management
   - Color contrast and visual indicators
   - Chart accessibility considerations

8. **Data Visualization Approach**: We're using Recharts for all chart components with consistent styling, theming, and accessibility features. Each chart component is designed to be responsive and provide clear data representation with appropriate tooltips and legends.

## Technical Decisions

- Comprehensive theme system with CSS variables for light/dark mode
- Semantic color tokens for improved accessibility and maintainability
- Modal-based editing for entities (accounts, categories, transactions)
- Component-based Toast notification system for consistent user feedback
- Feature Sliced Design (FSD) for frontend
- TypeScript for type safety with strict typing
- Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- Framer Motion for consistent animations
- Grid-based responsive layouts for dashboard components
- Focus trapping in modals and dropdowns for better accessibility
- Recharts integration for financial data visualization
- Provider pattern for context-based data management

## Known Issues

- Mock data remains in subscription module
- Some UI components still need to be updated with new theme variables
- Incomplete error handling and loading states in some components
- Incomplete test coverage
- AI insights placeholder needs real implementation
- debt_give/debt_take are not distinguished in backend logic due to current Prisma schema; both are mapped to 'debt'
- Need better documentation for chart components and accessibility guidelines

### Next Steps

- Connect the Analytics page to real transaction and category data
- Implement more advanced filtering capabilities
- Develop the AI insights backend functionality
- Add data export and report generation features
- Enhance accessibility features for chart components
