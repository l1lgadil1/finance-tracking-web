# Progress: AqshaTracker Project

## Current Status

### Backend
- **Project Initialization:** Complete.
- **Memory Bank:** Initial documentation created and maintained during build.
- **Backend Code:** MVP implementation complete according to the plan.

### Frontend
- **Project Structure:** Implemented Feature Sliced Design architecture.
- **Design System:** Created design tokens and component library with blue theme.
- **Core UI Components:** Built Button, Card, Input, Badge, Avatar components.
- **Layout Components:** Implemented responsive Header and basic page layouts.
- **Internationalization:** Set up i18n system with locale switching.
- **Theme Support:** Implemented light/dark mode with theming.

## What Works

### Backend
- **Core Setup:** `ConfigModule`, `PrismaModule`, Global Pipes, API Prefix, Swagger.
- **Authentication:** Registration (with default Profile/Account), Login, JWT Handling, `JwtAuthGuard`, `@CurrentUser` decorator.
- **CRUD Modules:** Functional endpoints for Profile, Account, Category, Transaction (including balance updates and filtering), Goal, Subscription (mock), AIRequestLog (mock).
- **Data Scoping:** All CRUD operations are scoped to the authenticated user.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger UI is configured and endpoints are documented.

### Frontend
- **Feature Sliced Design Structure:** Organized code into layers (app, pages, widgets, features, entities, shared).
- **Component Library:** Reusable UI components with various styles and states.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout approach with responsive components.
- **Theming:** Light/dark mode support with CSS variables.
- **Internationalization:** Multi-language support with locale switching.
- **State Management:** Basic global state with Zustand.
- **API Integration Setup:** API client structure for backend communication.
- **Routing:** Next.js routing with locale support.
- **Visualization:** Data chart with filtering options.

## What's Left to Build

### Backend
- **Refined Transaction Logic:** Enhanced debt handling, validation improvements.
- **Advanced Filtering/Pagination:** Implement pagination for list endpoints.
- **Testing:** Unit and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment Setup:** Dockerfile optimizations, CI/CD pipeline.

- **Form Validation:** Client-side validation for all forms.
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests for components and features.
- **Progressive Web App:** PWA configuration for offline capabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:** Code splitting, image optimization, etc.

## Known Issues/Blocks

### Backend
- Persistent linter errors related to TS/ESLint configuration with Prisma/NestJS types.
- The `as any` type casts in controllers returning DTOs should be replaced with proper mapping.
- Deleting Profiles/Accounts/Categories does not currently check for associated Transactions or non-zero balances.

### Frontend
- TypeScript errors with Framer Motion components (particularly in Button component).
- Need full accessibility audit and improvements.
- Mobile navigation needs enhancement for complex navigation scenarios.
- Need to implement proper error handling for API requests.
- Form management and validation strategy should be standardized.
