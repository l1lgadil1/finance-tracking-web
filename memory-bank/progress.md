# Progress: AqshaTracker Backend MVP

## Current Status (End of Initial MVP Build)

- **Project Initialization:** Complete.
- **Memory Bank:** Initial documentation created and maintained during build.
- **Backend Code:** MVP implementation complete according to the plan.

## What Works

- **Core Setup:** `ConfigModule`, `PrismaModule`, Global Pipes, API Prefix, Swagger.
- **Authentication:** Registration (with default Profile/Account), Login, JWT Handling, `JwtAuthGuard`, `@CurrentUser` decorator.
- **CRUD Modules:** Functional endpoints for Profile, Account, Category, Transaction (including balance updates and filtering), Goal, Subscription (mock), AIRequestLog (mock).
- **Data Scoping:** All CRUD operations are scoped to the authenticated user.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger UI is configured and endpoints are documented.

## What's Left to Build (Potential Next Steps - Post MVP)

- **Refined Transaction Logic:**
    - More robust `debt_repay` handling (e.g., linking to original debt).
    - Handling balance recalculations on transaction `update`/`delete`.
    - Validation of category type against transaction type.
- **Advanced Filtering/Pagination:** Implement pagination for list endpoints.
- **Default/Global Categories:** Implement logic for shared categories (if needed).
- **Enhanced Validation:** More specific cross-field validation where necessary.
- **Testing:** Unit and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment Setup:** Dockerfile optimizations, CI/CD pipeline.
- **Real Subscription/AI Logic:** Replace mock implementations.
- **User Profile Enhancements:** Adding currency, settings etc.
- **Error Handling:** More specific error codes/formats if required.
- **File Uploads:** (e.g., for icons or attachments).
- **Notifications/WebSockets:** (e.g., for real-time updates).

## Known Issues/Blocks

- Persistent linter errors related to TS/ESLint configuration with Prisma/NestJS types were observed during development but did not block functionality based on standard practices.
- The `as any` type casts in controllers returning DTOs should be replaced with proper mapping/transformation for production readiness.
- Deleting Profiles/Accounts/Categories does not currently check for associated Transactions or non-zero balances.
