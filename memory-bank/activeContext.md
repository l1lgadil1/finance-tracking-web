# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are working on improving the UI/UX and data visualization capabilities of the AqshaTracker financial tracking application. We've enhanced the existing UI components, implemented responsive dashboard layouts for financial data visualization, improved the theme system with consistent color variables, and enhanced accessibility.

## Current Work

We have recently improved the application's main dashboard layout and navigation experience with particular focus on mobile responsiveness and UI consistency. We've redesigned the sidebar navigation, enhanced the header UI, and implemented a new tab-based navigation approach for nested pages like Settings.

### Recent Changes

- Ensured consistent height between header and sidebar by setting fixed heights and alignment
- Made the burger menu button visible only on mobile devices to improve desktop UI
- Streamlined header on mobile by hiding username/email details, showing only avatar
- Redesigned the Settings page navigation for mobile with a horizontal tab-based approach 
- Implemented scrollable tabs with navigation arrows for the Settings page on mobile
- Eliminated the need for a secondary burger menu in nested routes
- Made the entire dashboard layout more responsive with proper overflow handling
- Fixed active link highlighting across the application
- Made content full-width by default and sidebar hidden initially
- Implemented route change detection using Next.js usePathname hook for immediate UI updates
- Added automatic mobile sidebar closing when changing routes for better UX
- Used existing theme variables consistently across all components

4. Develop the AI insights backend functionality for smarter financial recommendations
5. Add data export and report generation features to the Analytics page
6. Enhance accessibility features specifically for chart components
7. Update remaining components to use the theme system
8. Implement comprehensive loading and error states across the application
9. Complete test coverage for UI components

## Active Decisions

1. **Layout Strategy**: We've decided to make the main content full-width by default with a collapsible sidebar. This maximizes screen space for important financial information while keeping navigation accessible when needed.

2. **Mobile Navigation Approach**: For nested pages like Settings, we're using horizontal tab navigation instead of burger menus to improve usability and provide better visibility of available options.

3. **Component Architecture**: We've decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme variables, and Framer Motion for animations to create a polished user experience.

4. **Financial Data Display**: We're standardizing on currency display formats, consistent visualization of financial metrics, and intuitive data entry methods specific to financial workflows.

5. **Theme Strategy**: We're implementing a comprehensive theming system with semantic color tokens (bg-background, text-foreground, etc.) for consistent UI across the application, supporting both light and dark modes. All components must use these tokens instead of hardcoded colors.

6. **UI Component Structure**: Components are organized in a modular way in `src/shared/ui` directory, with each component having its own folder containing index.tsx file and any related sub-components.

7. **Transaction Visualization**: We've standardized on visual indicators for transaction types (income, expense, transfer, debt) with consistent color coding and iconography.

8. **Dashboard Layout**: We've implemented a flexible dashboard layout system that works across different screen sizes with special attention to mobile responsiveness. The sidebar is collapsed by default to maximize content area.

9. **Accessibility Strategy**: We've adopted a comprehensive approach to accessibility, focusing on:
   - Proper semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA attributes and landmarks
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Focus management
   - Color contrast and visual indicators
   - Chart accessibility considerations

10. **Data Visualization Approach**: We're using Recharts for all chart components with consistent styling, theming, and accessibility features. Each chart component is designed to be responsive and provide clear data representation with appropriate tooltips and legends.

## Technical Decisions

- Comprehensive theme system with CSS variables for light/dark mode
- Semantic color tokens for improved accessibility and maintainability
- Modal-based editing for entities (accounts, categories, transactions)
- Component-based Toast notification system for consistent user feedback
- Feature Sliced Design (FSD) for frontend
- TypeScript for type safety with strict typing
- Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- Framer Motion for consistent animations
- Grid-based responsive layouts for dashboard components
- Focus trapping in modals and dropdowns for better accessibility
- Recharts integration for financial data visualization
- Provider pattern for context-based data management
- Collapsible sidebar with route change detection for improved navigation experience
- Horizontal tab navigation for Settings on mobile devices

## Known Issues

- Mock data remains in subscription module
- Some UI components still need to be updated with new theme variables
- Incomplete error handling and loading states in some components
- Incomplete test coverage
- AI insights placeholder needs real implementation
- debt_give/debt_take are not distinguished in backend logic due to current Prisma schema; both are mapped to 'debt'
- Need better documentation for chart components and accessibility guidelines

### Next Steps

- Connect the Analytics page to real transaction and category data
- Implement more advanced filtering capabilities
- Develop the AI insights backend functionality
- Add data export and report generation features
- Enhance accessibility features for chart components
