# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are working on improving the UI/UX and data visualization capabilities of the AqshaTracker financial tracking application. We've enhanced the existing UI components, implemented responsive dashboard layouts for financial data visualization, improved the theme system with consistent color variables, and enhanced accessibility.

## Current Work

We have recently improved the application's main dashboard layout by fixing the sidebar UX issues and ensuring proper screen-responsive behavior. We've also enhanced the UI/UX of the Analytics page with detailed financial visualizations and insights.

- Fixed sidebar active link highlighting to properly reflect current route during client-side navigation
- Implemented route change detection using Next.js usePathname hook for immediate sidebar state updates
- Added automatic mobile sidebar closing when changing routes for better UX
- Created a comprehensive UI/UX design for the Analytics page with multiple visualization components
- Implemented responsive layouts with proper desktop, tablet, and mobile considerations
- Integrated existing FinancialSummaryCard components for key metrics display
- Used Recharts library for various chart types (bar, pie, line) with theme awareness
- Added time period selection controls with custom date range functionality
- Implemented AI insights section for displaying financial recommendations
- Created comprehensive documentation for the Analytics page design
- Fixed integration issues with DashboardDataProvider by properly wrapping components and passing locale

5. Add data export and report generation features to the Analytics page
6. Enhance accessibility features specifically for chart components
7. Update remaining components to use the theme system
8. Implement comprehensive loading and error states across the application
9. Enhance mobile experience for financial tracking on-the-go
10. Complete test coverage for UI components

## Active Decisions

1. **Layout Strategy**: We've decided to make the main content full-width by default with a collapsible sidebar. This maximizes screen space for important financial information while keeping navigation accessible when needed.

2. **Component Architecture**: We've decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme variables, and Framer Motion for animations to create a polished user experience.

3. **Financial Data Display**: We're standardizing on currency display formats, consistent visualization of financial metrics, and intuitive data entry methods specific to financial workflows.

4. **Theme Strategy**: We're implementing a comprehensive theming system with semantic color tokens (bg-background, text-foreground, etc.) for consistent UI across the application, supporting both light and dark modes. All components must use these tokens instead of hardcoded colors.

5. **UI Component Structure**: Components are organized in a modular way in `src/shared/ui` directory, with each component having its own folder containing index.tsx file and any related sub-components.

6. **Transaction Visualization**: We've standardized on visual indicators for transaction types (income, expense, transfer, debt) with consistent color coding and iconography.

7. **Dashboard Layout**: We've implemented a flexible dashboard layout system that works across different screen sizes with special attention to mobile responsiveness. The sidebar is collapsed by default to maximize content area.

8. **Accessibility Strategy**: We've adopted a comprehensive approach to accessibility, focusing on:
   - Proper semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA attributes and landmarks
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Focus management
   - Color contrast and visual indicators
   - Chart accessibility considerations

9. **Data Visualization Approach**: We're using Recharts for all chart components with consistent styling, theming, and accessibility features. Each chart component is designed to be responsive and provide clear data representation with appropriate tooltips and legends.

## Technical Decisions

- Comprehensive theme system with CSS variables for light/dark mode
- Semantic color tokens for improved accessibility and maintainability
- Modal-based editing for entities (accounts, categories, transactions)
- Component-based Toast notification system for consistent user feedback
- Feature Sliced Design (FSD) for frontend
- TypeScript for type safety with strict typing
- Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- Framer Motion for consistent animations
- Grid-based responsive layouts for dashboard components
- Focus trapping in modals and dropdowns for better accessibility
- Recharts integration for financial data visualization
- Provider pattern for context-based data management
- Collapsible sidebar with route change detection for improved navigation experience

## Known Issues

- Mock data remains in subscription module
- Some UI components still need to be updated with new theme variables
- Incomplete error handling and loading states in some components
- Incomplete test coverage
- AI insights placeholder needs real implementation
- debt_give/debt_take are not distinguished in backend logic due to current Prisma schema; both are mapped to 'debt'
- Need better documentation for chart components and accessibility guidelines

### Next Steps

- Connect the Analytics page to real transaction and category data
- Implement more advanced filtering capabilities
- Develop the AI insights backend functionality
- Add data export and report generation features
- Enhance accessibility features for chart components
