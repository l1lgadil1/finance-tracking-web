# AqshaTracker Dashboard UI/UX Improvement Guide

This document outlines UI/UX improvements needed throughout the AqshaTracker dashboard to ensure consistency, accessibility, and optimal user experience. All components should follow the examples in the UI-Showcase page.

## Core Principles

1. **Consistent Styling**
   - All cards should use `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-200` class
   - Maintain consistent padding and spacing between components
   - Use semantic colors for financial data (green for income, red for expenses)

2. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
   - Proper ARIA attributes should be used throughout
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text
   - Provide screen reader announcements for dynamic content

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Components should adapt smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop views
   - Use appropriate grid layouts for different viewport sizes
   - Ensure touch targets are at least 44px in size for mobile

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Use consistent typography for headings, subheadings, and body text
   - Maintain clear information hierarchy within components
   - Use whitespace effectively to separate distinct information

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Cards
- Use the Card component from the UI library
- Include proper CardHeader and CardBody components
- Apply consistent shadow and hover effects
- Maintain padding consistency

### Buttons
- Use appropriate button variants based on action importance:
  - Primary: Main/positive actions
  - Destructive: Delete/negative actions
  - Ghost/Outline: Secondary actions
- Include appropriate icon + text combinations
- Maintain consistent sizing based on context

### Data Visualizations
- Use consistent color schemes for all charts
- Provide clear legends and labels
- Ensure charts are accessible with proper ARIA descriptions
- Implement responsive sizing for various screens

### Tables
- Use proper table semantics (thead, tbody, th with scope)
- Implement responsive strategies for mobile views
- Include proper sorting and pagination for larger datasets
- Maintain consistent styling for similar data types

### Forms
- Group related fields together
- Provide clear validation messages
- Implement consistent label placement
- Use appropriate input types for different data

## Animation Standards

- Use Framer Motion with consistent parameters:
```jsx
// Container animations
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.08 }
  }
};

// Item animations
const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 15 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.4 }
  }
};
```

## Color Usage

- Financial data should follow these color standards:
  - Income/Positive: text-green-600 dark:text-green-400
  - Expense/Negative: text-red-600 dark:text-red-400
  - Neutral/Balance: text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400
  
- Status indicators should use:
  - Success: Badge with variant="success"
  - Warning: Badge with variant="warning"
  - Error: Badge with variant="error"
  - Info: Badge with variant="info"

## Loading and Error States

### Loading States
- Use consistent loading spinners
- Implement skeleton loaders for content where appropriate
- Add appropriate ARIA attributes: `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-live="polite"`

### Error States
- Provide clear, helpful error messages
- Use appropriate error styling with variant="error"
- Implement retry mechanisms where possible
